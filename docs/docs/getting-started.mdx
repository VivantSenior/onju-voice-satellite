# Get started

This page will guide you through setting up your new Onju Voice PCB with ESPHome. It will take you through the steps of replacing the PCB in the Google Nest mini, installing the firmware and configure the device. It should take 15-20 minutes, but probably less.

## Step 1: Install firmware

Use the method below to provide your Onju Voice PCB with the correct firmware.

1. Press the blue **connect** button below, a pop-up window will appear with a list of available USB devices.
2. Plug the USB cable into the Onju Voice PCB and connect it to your computer.
3. In the pop-up window, there should now appear a new entry. Select this USB serial port and click **Connect**.
4. Select **Install Onju Voice Satellite**, hold down the `BOOT` button on the Onju Voice PCB and click **Install**.
5. Once the installation is complete, select **Next**.
    - Add the Onju Voice Satellite to your Wi-Fi network:
      - When prompted, select your network from the list and enter the credentials to your 2.4&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi network.
      - Select **Connect**.
      - The Onju Voice Satellite now joined your network.
6. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully installed the firmware on your Onju Voice Satellite.
    - The LED's on the Onju Voice PCB should now be blinking green.

:::note
If your device does not appear in the list, make sure you are using a USB data cable (i.e., not power-only), and try installing the [driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) for the serial chip.

## Step 3: Connect to Home Assistant

You have two options to add the Onju Voice Satellite to Home Assistant.

### Option 1: During firmware installation

    - This opens the **My** link to Home Assistant (see image below).
      - If you have not used My Home Assistant before, you will need to configure it. If your Home Assistant URL is not accessible on `http://homeassistant.local:8123`, replace it with the URL to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Click on **Open the link**.
3. It opens your Home Assistant instance and asks you to set up, click **OK**.
4. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully added the Onju Voice Satellite to your Home Assistant instance.

1. Under [**Settings** > **Devices & Services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/), your Onju Voice Satellite should be discovered (see image below).
2. Click on **Configure**, at the discovered device.
3. It asks if you want to add the device and click **Submit**.
4. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully added the Onju Voice Satellite to your Home Assistant instance.
