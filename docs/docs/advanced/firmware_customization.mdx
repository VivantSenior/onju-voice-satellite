title: Customizing the Firmware
description: How to adopt and customize the firmware for your own needs.

Since the Onju Voice Satellite's firmware is based on [ESPHome](https://esphome.io), making
customizations to the firmware is as easy as editing some YAML. The best way to modify the
firmware config is by installing the [ESPHome Dashboard](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html).

## Adopting the Device

Once ESPHome Dashboard is running, and your Onju Voice Satellite is connected to your network,
it should prompt you to adopt it.

Go through the adoption flow; it will do these things:

1. Create an ESPHome configuration file
2. Set an API encryption key (used by Home Assistant or other native API consumers)
3. Bake the Wi-Fi credentials into the firmware
4. Install the new firmware to the device
